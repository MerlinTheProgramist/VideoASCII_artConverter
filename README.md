It works like that: 
You run a the py script with following arguments:
  py ASCI_video_converter.py video.avi
you put your video file in to input folder and script outputs in in output folder with the same name
  
 I recoomned using AVI video file, but sometimes it works with mp4 too
 I will try to improove it over time and add new functionality, Im open on submission
